    "2. What is the importance of copyright?\n",
    "\n",
    "Copyright is important because it protects people's property from being used illegally without their permission. This prevents things like plagiarism and gives the creator of the copyrighted item sole ownership (unless otherwise stated) so that nobody else can make proffits from it. At times it can also be used for multiple things such as preserving cultural heritage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is a way people can harm individuals or groups through open source data? \n",
    "\n",
    "They can use open source data for their own good by disguising it as something helpful and putting viruses or malware in it. Additionally, the ability to edit open source data could lead to people spreading misinformation on open source platforms in order to push a personal agenda.\n",

    "5. How do you see intellectual property in 20 years (be creative)?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think intellectual property will have a lot more legal implications and there will be a lot more things that people can own. With the recent development of NFTs, it shows that people will have the drive to own almost anything, even pictures. I think that in the future there might be copyrights on usage of certain phrases and maybe even ideas that might not be possible to execute with the given technology (for example nobody except one company is allowed to invent things like time machines. They haven't been invented yet but nobody else is allowed to invent it other than the company that copyrighted the idea.). These are just examples to explain the extent to which I believe intellectual property will be protected"
