    "For our project we made a gaming website. Most online gaming websites simply allow you to play games and nothing else so we wanted to create a more immersive experience with features like leader boards, adding friends, and even a chatroom for gamers to talk to each other.\n",

    "### TEAM CONTRIBUTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "I worked on creating the signup and login page (frontend and backend) along with the database where people can see all the users on the site. I did this by creating an user API that facilitated the login and signup processes and pointed out any errors. I also created the chatroom (frontend and backend) where players can interact with each other and created an API for it facilitate the messages. I used an sqlite table in everything I created to store things such as users, messages, and information about the messages that were sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Josh created one of the games and added a leader board to his game. He did this by creating a simple API for the leader board and stored scores in an sqlite table. He also created the friend system allowing people to add existing users on the side to their friend list, creating an API to facilitate this and storing friends in a table. In addition to this Josh did styling for almost the entire website (SASS) other than the login page.\n",
