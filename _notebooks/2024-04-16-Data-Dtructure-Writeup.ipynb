    "      - **Successful Data Storage:** If a valid message is provided, the code creates a new instance of ChatMessage, adds it to the database session, and commits it to the database. Upon successful storage, it returns a JSON response indicating that the data was stored successfully.\n",

    " - **In Postman, show the JSON response for error for 400 when missing body on a POST request.**\n",
    "\n",
    "      - **Purpose and Method**: The /edit endpoint is designed for updating existing messages in the chat application. It uses the HTTP PUT method, which is typically reserved for updating or replacing an existing resource on the server. This approach adheres to RESTful API design principles, where PUT requests are idempotent, meaning repeated requests should result in the same state without additional changes after the first request.\n",
    "   \n",
    "      - **Data Handling**: When a request is made to the /edit endpoint, it expects JSON data containing at least two pieces of information: message_id and message. The message_id is used to identify and locate the specific message in the database that needs to be updated, and message contains the new text that will replace the old message content. The endpoint then processes this data to update the specified message in the database.\n",
    "   \n",
    "      - **Response Mechanism**: After the update operation, the endpoint provides feedback through JSON responses. If the update is successful, it returns a JSON object with a success message, such as {\"message\": \"Message updated successfully!\"}. If the specified message ID does not exist or the required data is missing, it responds with an error message and an appropriate HTTP status code, such as 404 Not Found for missing messages or 400 Bad Request for incomplete data.\n",

    " - Discuss concepts and understanding of Decision Tree analysis algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Decision tree analysis employs a tree-like model of decisions, where each decision leads to a series of consequences.**\n",
    "\n",
    "      - **Decision Tree Nodes (Decision Nodes):** Decision nodes in a decision tree represent points where decisions are made. At each decision node, the data is split according to certain criteria based on the input features. These nodes evaluate the input data and make decisions that direct the flow of the data to different branches of the tree based on specific conditions. Essentially, these are the \"question\" nodes, asking if the data meets certain criteria, then directing the analysis flow accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "      - **Terminal Nodes (Leaf Nodes):** Terminal nodes, also known as leaf nodes, are the endpoints of a decision tree where no further splitting occurs. Each terminal node represents an output or a decision result. These nodes are reached once all the relevant conditions have been satisfied along the path from the root to the leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "      - **Root Node:** The root node is the starting point of a decision tree. It is from this node that the decision-making process begins, leading to multiple decision nodes based on the dataset's attributes. All nodes, through their branches, eventually trace back to this root node, which holds the initial decision criterion that guides the entire tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **How they work**\n",
    "\n",
    "      -  **Decision Making Process:** The decision tree starts at the root node, where it chooses the best feature of the dataset to split the data based on a statistical measure like information gain or Gini impurity. This node directs the dataset into branches leading to decision nodes, which further split the data by testing other features. This splitting continues, decision by decision, following the path that the data points take based on their attribute values, until a stopping condition is met.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      - **Terminal Node Outcomes:** Once the conditions of the decision nodes are no longer met or when a predefined depth of the tree is reached, the algorithm stops splitting and the data points are grouped at the terminal nodes, or leaf nodes. Each terminal node represents a final decision or prediction outcome based on the combination of feature conditions that led to that specific leaf, encapsulating the end result of the decision path from the root.\n",
